Features:

Temperature (T)
Ambient Pressure (AP)
Relative Humidity (RH)
Exhaust Vacuum (V)

In the provided dataset, PE stands for "Net hourly electrical energy output" measured in megawatts (MW). 
It is the target variable that we aim to predict using the other variables in the dataset, which are:

AT: Temperature (in Â°C)
V: Exhaust Vacuum (in cm Hg)
AP: Ambient Pressure (in mbar)
RH: Relative Humidity (in %)
