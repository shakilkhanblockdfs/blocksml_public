/**
Challenge: 

Part 2: 
- Add a `header` element with a nested `nav` element. Inside the `nav`,
  include a `img` element with the image of the React logo inside
  (src="./react-logo.png") and make sure to set the width to something
  more manageable so it doesn't take up the whole screen
- Add an `h1` with some text describing the page. (E.g. "Reasons
  I'm excited to learn React"). Place it above the ordered list.
- Add a `footer` after the list that says: 
    "Â© 20xx <last name here> development. All rights reserved."
