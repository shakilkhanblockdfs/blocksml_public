In the current market, numerous Language Model (LLM) options are available, including prominent ones like GPT4, Claude, Gemini, and Mistral, among others. 
However, selecting the most suitable LLM for your specific needs can be a daunting task.

To facilitate your decision-making process, here is a curated list of popular benchmarks, each designed to assess specific facets of LLM performance:

RACE: Evaluates the comprehension of passages from real-world scenarios by presenting multiple-choice questions.
HellaSwag: This benchmark is geared towards testing the common sense of LLMs by predicting plausible outcomes in given situations.
SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset): This benchmark assesses the ability of LLMs in reading comprehension and answering questions based on provided passages.
MMLU: This benchmark combines text with images/videos to assess LLMs' multimodal language and vision skills.
GSM8K: Tests advanced mathematical word problem-solving skills that require multi-step reasoning.
HumanEval-X: An extension of HumanEval, featuring more challenging coding tasks.
BoolQ: Designed to test query understanding through yes/no questions based on short passages.
ARC: Presents multiple-choice reasoning questions that necessitate extracting information from a scientific database.
CodeXGLUE: Evaluates LLMs' understanding and generation capabilities across various programming languages.
PIQA: Tests LLMs' physical reasoning abilities through questions about diagrams and situations.
APPS: Assesses LLMs' proficiency in understanding Python code.
HumanEval: This benchmark evaluates LLMs' coding abilities by requiring them to write functional programs.
LAMBADA: Focused on evaluating whether an LLM can predict the correct final word in a passage by comprehending its context.
CommonsenseQA: Assesses the commonsense reasoning abilities of LLMs through multiple-choice questions involving everyday scenarios.
NLVR2: Determines whether a statement accurately describes a set of images.
MultiRC: Requires LLMs to reason over multiple passages to answer multiple-choice questions effectively.
VCR: Evaluates LLMs' comprehension of situations depicted in images through question-answering.
OpenBookQA: Evaluates LLMs' ability to answer science-related multiple-choice questions using an open book of facts.

By selecting an LLM with strong performance on relevant benchmarks, you can ensure that it effectively meets your specific needs and requirements.
